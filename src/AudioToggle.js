import React, { Component } from 'react';


// ==============================
// This is the 'audio on/audio off' button which is
// found in the footer.

// Two things are going on here:

// 1) When the user clicks the button, the sound is turned on
// via the function soundButtonToggle (found in App.js)

// 2) The state 'isAudioOn' is passed in from App.js as a prop.
// If the state of 'isAudioOn' is true, then the audio-off icon will show
// If the state of 'isAudioOn' is false, then the audio-on icon will show
// ==============================
